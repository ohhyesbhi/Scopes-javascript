//What do you think JS is compiled or interpreted language ? Let's see wheteher it is interpreted or compiled


function fun ( ){
    console...log("i am inside fun");
    return 0
}

console.log("welcome")
fun();
console...log("end")


 // o/p -: console...log("i am inside fun"); SyntaxError: Unexpected token '...'

 // if js was interpreted then atleast in o/p we could have got welcome , so hence we can say javascript is not interpreted language
